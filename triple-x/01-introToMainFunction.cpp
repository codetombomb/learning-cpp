    INT MAIN() AND WHITE SPACE POINTS
    ----------------------------------

    1) int main() is required in every c++ program
    2) Without int main(), a c++ program will not run!
    3) We return 0 to signal that the program has run successfully
    4) Compiler ignores white space
    5) Code style improves readability
